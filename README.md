c5-rss-displayer-templates
==========================

Image and Thumbnail templates for the concrete5 RSS Displayer block

Notes
-----

The show_thumbnail templates don't actually create thumbnails, but instead
just set the max width and height.  So if the original image is huge you
still get that bandwidth needed to download it to the browser.  It just
looks smaller.
